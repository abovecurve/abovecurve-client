## jsconfig.json

This app makes use of a jsconfig.json file to create absolute paths. It is suggested that you import sibling files or files down the directory tree as you normally would, starting with a "./", however you may take advantage of absolute paths that originate from `src/`.

i.e. if you would like to import the Map component from the index file found in `src/components/map` you can use `import Map from 'components/map';`

All top level directories are written in PascalCase to help differential imports from npm packages and source code.

If you are a VS Code user, you should not have to make any changes and absolute paths will work correctly.

If you are a WebStorm or IntelliJ user, please mark the src directory as your Resources Root, which can be done through you're IDE. More information can be [found in this article](https://https://medium.com/hackernoon/absolute-imports-with-create-react-app-4c6cfb66c35d) by David Gilbertson

# CRA Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
